1.
Concurrency - the property of program, algorithm, or problem decomposition into order-independent or partially-ordered units.

Parallelism - many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously

Difference - Parallelism implementation of concurrency. Concurrency = overlapping time periods, Parallelism = simultaneously

2.
Increase of parallelism / faster computation.

3.
Reduce waiting, improve throughput, resource utizliation, average reponse time

4.
Harder

5.
Processes - Executing instance of an application. OS-managed, own address space
Threads - OS-managed, same address space as parent and all its other threads.
Green Threads - thread that is not OS-managed
Coroutines - Like thread, but not OS-managed and not concurrent (no co-operatively multitasking)

6.
Thread

7.
GIL - mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once
